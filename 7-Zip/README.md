7-Zip
-----

Send to actions to quickly compress and extract with 7-Zip.

Access “send to” folder in Explorer: <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd> `shell:sendto` <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

The extraction script intelligently extracts contents of archive into separate folder if there is more than one item inside the archive (to prevent [archive-bombing](http://www.linfo.org/tarbomb.html)).
