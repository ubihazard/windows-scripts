Windows Color Scheme
--------------------

A gray color scheme with separate colors for active and inactive windows. Fixes eye-popping white title bars everywhere. The main color is based on Visual Studio title bar color. Easy on eyes.

You might need to use Control Panel in order to enforce the new colors and log out and log back in for the new colors to apply everywhere.
