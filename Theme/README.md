Windows 10 Colors
=================

A gray color scheme with separate colors for active and inactive windows. Fixes white title bars everywhere which rarely combine with the rest of UI in programs. The main color is based on Visual Studio title bar color. Easy on eyes.

You might need to use Control Panel in order to enforce the new colors and log out and log back in for the new colors to apply everywhere.
